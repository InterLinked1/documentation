# REALTIME_DESTROY()

### Synopsis

RealTime Destroy Function.

### Description

This function acts in the same way as REALTIME(....) does, except that it destroys the matched record in the RT engine.<br>


/// note
If 'live\_dangerously' in 'asterisk.conf' is set to 'no', this function can only be read from the dialplan, and not directly from external protocols. It can, however, be executed as a write operation ('REALTIME\_DESTROY(family, fieldmatch)=ignored')
///

```

REALTIME_DESTROY(family,fieldmatch,matchvalue,delim1,delim2)
```
##### Arguments


* `family`
