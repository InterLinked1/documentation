##### Arguments


* `direction` - List of frame types to be dropped for the specified direction. Direction can be 'TX' or 'RX'. The 'TX' direction will prevent Asterisk from sending frames to a channel, and the 'RX' direction will prevent Asterisk from receiving frames from a channel.<br>
Subsequent calls to this function will replace previous settings, allowing certain frames to be dropped only temporarily, for instance.<br>
Below are the different types of frames that can be dropped. Other actions may need to be taken in conjunction with use of this function: for instance, if you drop ANSWER control frames, you should explicitly use 'Progress()' for your call or undesired behavior may occur.<br>

    * `DTMF_END`
