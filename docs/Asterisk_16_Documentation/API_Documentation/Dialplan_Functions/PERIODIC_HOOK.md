# PERIODIC_HOOK()

### Synopsis

Execute a periodic dialplan hook into the audio of a call.

### Description

For example, you could use this function to enable playing a periodic 'beep' sound in a call.<br>

<br>

``` title="Example: To turn on"

same => n,Set(BEEPID=${PERIODIC_HOOK(hooks,beep,180)})


```
``` title="Example: To turn off"

same => n,Set(PERIODIC_HOOK(${BEEPID})=off)


```
``` title="Example: To turn back on again later"

same => n,Set(PERIODIC_HOOK(${BEEPID})=on)


```
It is important to note that the hook does not actually run on the channel itself. It runs asynchronously on a new channel. Any audio generated by the hook gets injected into the call for the channel PERIODIC\_HOOK() was set on.<br>

<br>

The hook dialplan will have two variables available. **HOOK\_CHANNEL** is the channel the hook is enabled on. **HOOK\_ID** is the hook ID for enabling or disabling the hook.<br>

PERIODIC_HOOK(context,extension,interval,hook_id)
```

* `extension` - (On Read Only) The hook extension.<br>

* `interval` - (On Read Only) Number of seconds in between hook runs. Whole seconds only.<br>
