# CHANNEL()

### Synopsis

Gets/sets various pieces of information about the channel.

### Description

Gets/sets various pieces of information about the channel, additional _item_ may be available from the channel driver; see its documentation for details. Any _item_ requested that is not available on the current channel will return an empty string.<br>

``` title="Example: Standard CHANNEL item examples"

; Push a hangup handler subroutine existing at dialplan
; location default,s,1 onto the current channel
same => n,Set(CHANNEL(hangup_handler_push)=default,s,1)

; Set the current tonezone to Germany (de)
same => n,Set(CHANNEL(tonezone)=de)

; Set the allowed maximum number of forwarding attempts
same => n,Set(CHANNEL(max_forwards)=10)

; If this channel is ejected from its next bridge, and if
; the channel is not hung up, begin executing dialplan at
; location default,after-bridge,1
same => n,Set(CHANNEL(after_bridge_goto)=default,after-bridge,1)

; Log the current state of the channel
same => n,Log(NOTICE, This channel is: ${CHANNEL(state)})



```
