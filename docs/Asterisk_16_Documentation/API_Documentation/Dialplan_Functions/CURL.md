# CURL()

Retrieve content from a remote web or ftp server

### Description

When this function is read, a 'HTTP GET' (by default) will be used to retrieve the contents of the provided _url_. The contents are returned as the result of the function.<br>

``` title="Example: Displaying contents of a page"

exten => s,1,Verbose(0, ${CURL(http://localhost:8088/static/astman.css)})


```
When this function is written to, a 'HTTP GET' will be used to retrieve the contents of the provided _url_. The value written to the function specifies the destination file of the cURL'd resource.<br>

``` title="Example: Retrieving a file"

```

/// note
If 'live\_dangerously' in 'asterisk.conf' is set to 'no', this function can only be written to from the dialplan, and not directly from external protocols. Read operations are unaffected.
