# PJSIP_SEND_SESSION_REFRESH()

### Synopsis

W/O: Initiate a session refresh via an UPDATE or re-INVITE on an established media session

### Since

13.12.0, 14.1.0, 15.0.0

### Description

This function will cause the PJSIP stack to immediately refresh the media session for the channel. This will be done using either a re-INVITE (default) or an UPDATE request.<br>

This is most useful when combined with the _PJSIP\_MEDIA\_OFFER_ dialplan function, as it allows the formats in use on a channel to be re-negotiated after call setup.<br>


/// warning
The formats the endpoint supports are *not* checked or enforced by this function. Using this function to offer formats not supported by the endpoint *may* result in a loss of media.
///

``` title="Example: Re-negotiate format to g722"

; Within some existing extension on an answered channel

same => n,Set(PJSIP_SEND_SESSION_REFRESH()=invite)


```
