# res_pjsip_notify: Module that supports sending NOTIFY requests to endpoints from external sources

This configuration documentation is for functionality provided by res_pjsip_notify.

## Configuration File: pjsip_notify.conf

### [general]: Unused, but reserved.



### [notify]: Configuration of a NOTIFY request.

A key of 'Content' is treated as part of the message body and is appended in sequential order; any other header is treated as part of the SIP request.<br>
