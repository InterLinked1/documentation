# res_pjsip_acl: SIP ACL module

This configuration documentation is for functionality provided by res_pjsip_acl.

## Overview

*ACL*<br>

The ACL module used by 'res\_pjsip'. This module is independent of 'endpoints' and operates on all inbound SIP communication using res\_pjsip.<br>

There are two main ways of defining your ACL with the options provided. You can use the 'permit' and 'deny' options which act on *IP* addresses, or the 'contactpermit' and 'contactdeny' options which act on *Contact header* addresses in incoming REGISTER requests. You can combine the various options to create a mixed ACL.<br>

Additionally, instead of defining an ACL with options, you can reference IP or Contact header ACLs from the file *acl.conf* by using the 'acl' or 'contactacl' options.<br>
