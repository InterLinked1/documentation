# Record()

### Synopsis

Record to a file.

### Description

If filename contains '%d', these characters will be replaced with a number incremented by one each time the file is recorded. Use `core show file formats` to see the available formats on your system User can press '#' to terminate the recording and continue to the next priority. If the user hangs up during a recording, all data will be lost and the application will terminate.<br>


* `RECORDED_FILE` - Will be set to the final filename of the recording, without an extension.<br>

* `RECORD_STATUS` - This is the final status of the command<br>

    * `DTMF` - A terminating DTMF was received ('#' or '*', depending upon option 't')

    * `SILENCE` - The maximum silence occurred in the recording.

    * `SKIP` - The line was not yet answered and the 's' option was specified.

    * `TIMEOUT` - The maximum length was reached.

    * `HANGUP` - The channel was hung up.

    * `ERROR` - An unrecoverable error occurred, which resulted in a WARNING to the logs.
