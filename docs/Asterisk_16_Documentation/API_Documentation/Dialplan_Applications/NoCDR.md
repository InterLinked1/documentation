# NoCDR()

### Synopsis

Tell Asterisk to not maintain a CDR for this channel.

### Description

This application will tell Asterisk not to maintain a CDR for the current channel. This does *NOT* mean that information is not tracked; rather, if the channel is hung up no CDRs will be created for that channel.<br>

If a subsequent call to ResetCDR occurs, all non-finalized CDRs created for the channel will be enabled.<br>


/// note
This application is deprecated. Please use the CDR\_PROP function to disable CDRs on a channel.
///
